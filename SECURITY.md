# Security

## Reporting
If you discover a security issue, please open a private report (or contact the maintainer) rather than filing a public issue.

## Secrets policy
- Do not commit tokens, keys, certificates, or credentials.
- Diagnostics must redact secrets by default.
- Prefer Keychain for sensitive storage (implementation forthcoming).
