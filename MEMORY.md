# MEMORY.md

## Preferences / Process

- In this project, use the **Design skill** for outputs (UX reviews, UI states/copy, component specs, screenshot callouts, accessibility notes).
- Design feedback format: include **what’s good**, **what to change**, and a **small backlog of next design tasks**.

## GitHub workflow

- Do everything under **michaelasper**.
- Use **`gh` CLI only**; do **not** use the browser/Browser Relay for GitHub.
- For feedback, use **PR comments** (avoid formal review/approval tools like submitting reviews).

## Backlog / planning

- GitHub Project “hackpanel” is the canonical backlog: https://github.com/users/michaelasper/projects/2
  - Track design tasks as **issues/cards** in the project.
  - Keep cards up to date: move status and add labels/priority/size.
  - Use `gh project` and/or `gh api graphql` only (no browser).
