## Preferences / Process

- In this project, use the **Design skill** for outputs (UX reviews, UI states/copy, component specs, screenshot callouts, accessibility notes).
- Design feedback format: include **what’s good**, **what to change**, and a **small backlog of next design tasks**.
- **GitHub workflow:** do **not** use the browser/Browser Relay for GitHub.
  - Use `gh` CLI for PR view/checkout/comment/review.
  - Post Design-skill formatted notes as PR comments via `gh`.
