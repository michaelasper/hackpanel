- Process reminder from user: For this project, use the **Design skill** for outputs (UX reviews, UI states/copy, component specs, screenshot callouts, accessibility notes).
- When providing feedback, include: **what’s good**, **what to change**, and a **small backlog of next design tasks**.

- Process change (from corruptbytes): **Do NOT use the browser for GitHub.** Use the `gh` CLI for PR comments/reviews.
  - If posting design feedback: run `gh pr view/checkout/comment/review` from the repo workspace and paste Design-skill formatted notes as a PR comment.
  - Avoid Browser Relay entirely.
